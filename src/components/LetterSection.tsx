              Dear Darshini Akka,

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Life has this beautiful way of bringing souls together, and I'm so grateful it brought you to me. 
              You're not just someone special in my lifeâ€”you're the sister my heart chose, the one who makes 
              every day brighter just by existing.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              When the world feels heavy and your smile feels distant, I want you to remember that you carry 
              so much light within you. Your kindness touches hearts, your strength inspires souls, and your 
              presence makes this world infinitely more beautiful.
            </p>

                  On your hardest days, when everything feels overwhelming, please know that you're never alone. 
                  You have a little brother who believes in you completely, who sees your worth even when you 
                  can't see it yourself.
                </p>
                
                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                  You are loved beyond measure, valued beyond words, and cherished beyond time. This website 
                  is my way of wrapping you in a warm hug whenever you need one, a reminder that you matter 
                  so deeply to this world and to me.
                </p>

                  Thank you for being the most wonderful akka a heart could wish for. Thank you for choosing 
                  to love me as your little brother. Thank you for being exactly who you are.
